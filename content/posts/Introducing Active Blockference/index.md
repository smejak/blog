[Active Blockference](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceLab/ActiveBlockference) is an open-source Python package combining [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/) and [pymdp](https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp) libraries for cognitive complex systems modeling.

To learn more about Active Blockference, read its introductory paper *Active Blockference: cadCAD with Active Inference for cognitive systems modeling* (available in September 2022 at [IWAI](https://iwaiworkshop.github.io/)) or visit its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceLab/ActiveBlockference) containing example simulations.
