I am a student researcher and developer working at the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and Web3. I am developing tools for the decentralized AI economy at [Algovera](https://www.algovera.ai/) and am researching computational applications of active inference for artificial cognitive agents at the [Active Inference Institute](https://activeinference.org). I am also involved in decentralized science (DeSci) with my work on token engineering for the knowledge commons at [OpSci](https://opsci.io/).

I am interested in questions about intelligence and its role in balancing complexity (likely significant).
