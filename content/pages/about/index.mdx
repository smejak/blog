Hi! 

I'm Jakub.

#### A bit about me

I am currently working on [decentralized AI](https://www.algovera.ai/) and [DeSci](https://opsci.io/), and have most recently been going down the rabbit hole of [Active Inference](https://activeinference.org). I study mathematics and physics at university.

#### Topics that interest me
- active inference
- computational neuroscience
- artificial intelligence

Note: the three topics above are really exciting on their own, but even more so when considered together
- systems engineering in Web3
